## Virtual collections

Similar to the projection of assets using named queries, so can Manifests and Collections be projected into IIIF Collections through named queries. This is more suited to generating IIIF Collections based on facets, typically stored in the `tags` property of a Manifest or Collection. These can be combined with [Search services](enrichment) to provide powerful supporting services for application development.

You can also use existing (and future) static site generators or other tools to generate your own discovery and exploration user interfaces.<sup>[12](https://github.com/dlcs/private-protagonist/issues/12)</sup>

For example, the platform can run [Canopy](https://github.com/canopy-iiif/canopy-iiif) for you on IIIF Collections you have created, and can (if desired) host the resulting static site.
