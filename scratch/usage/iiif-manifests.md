* You can remove an asset from a Manifest without deleting it from the platform.
* You can find assets that are not currently members of any Manifest.
* You can add assets to spaces and later find them and include them in one or more Manifests
* You can add existing assets to a Manifest by searching on ID or on other metadata fields
* Collections appear as folders, Manifests as (...something both folder and document-ish...), with individual assets as thumbnail files within the Manifest.
