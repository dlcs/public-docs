## Adjuncts

Any asset registered in the IIIF Cloud Services platform can be accompanied by any number of supporting files, known as _adjuncts_.

Adjuncts are added via the portal or via the API. Any file can be an adjunct; the platform doesn't need to know what the file is. At the simplest level, the platform can be used to store and publish related files, for whatever purpose you need. Examples are transcriptions, or data generated from machine learning pipelines that are using the platform for storage.

If marked for publication, the adjunct will appear in the `seeAlso`, `rendering` or `annotations` property of any IIIF Canvases in Manifests generated from named queries, or from Manifests [explicitly created](iiif-manifests). Again, this is convenient for storing and publishing any files related to individual assets, for any purpose. 

The list of adjuncts also appears in the Single Asset Manifest - this is a IIIF Manifest available for every individual asset that uses IIIF to present all the files and services the platform can provide for an individual asset - image services, access control, adjuncts.

* You can supply the metadata and the content of an adjunct file directly via the API.
* You can register an adjunct using an _origin_, similar to an image asset, and the platform will fetch the file from the origin and store it.

## Adjuncts providing text for search

If an adjunct is in a text format understood by the platform, it can be used to generate IIIF Search services. Formats include plain text, METS-ALTO, hOCR and W3C TextualBody annotations.

Currently these services would sit outside the platform, but in a future version, the platform will generate search services from text-bearing adjuncts.
