As a REST API, the entry point allows navigation to other resources. The root of the API is a resource of type `EntryPoint`:

```json copy
{
    "@context": "https://dlcs.github.io/vocab/context/future.json",
    "@id": "https://api.dlc.services",
    "@type": "vocab:EntryPoint",
    "customers": "https://api.dlc.services/customers",
    "originStrategies": "https://api.dlc.services/originStrategies",
    "storagePolicies": "https://api.dlc.services/storagePolicies",
    "deliveryChannelPolicies": "https://api.dlc.services/deliveryChannelPolicies",
    "queue": "https://api.dlc.services/queue"
}
```

  href="https://github.com/dlcs/public-docs/blob/main/dlcs-docs-client/p04_entrypoint/entrypoint.py"
  description="The API EntryPoint is the gateway to all the other resources."
/>


This `EntryPoint` resource is like the API home page, and has the following properties:

## customers

A link to a paged [Collection](collections) of all [Customers](customer) in the API instance. This is only useful for navigation to your own Customer resource: while the endpoint provides a list of Customer URIs, they don't have any information (not even a name) and you can only further navigate into your own.

| domain | range | readonly | writeonly |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| vocab:EntryPoint | 🔗 hydra:Collection (of vocab:Customer) | True | False |

### HTTP operations

| Method | Label | Expects | Returns | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| GET | Retrieves all customers | - | hydra:Collection | 200 OK |

For example, a `GET` on the customers URI might return:

```json copy
{
    "@context": "https://dlcs.github.io/vocab/context/future.json",
    "@id": "https://api.dlc.services/customers",
    "@type": "Collection",
    "totalItems": 4,
    "pageSize": 100,
    "member": [
        {
            "@id": "https://api.dlc.services/customers/1",
            "@type": "vocab:Customer"
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://api.dlc.services/customers/2",
            "@type": "vocab:Customer"
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://api.dlc.services/customers/3",
            "@type": "vocab:Customer"
        },
        {
            "@id": "https://api.dlc.services/customers/4",
            "@type": "vocab:Customer"
        }
    ]
}
```

These are only useful as navigation properties to an individual [Customer](customer), and you are only permitted to see your own Customer resource.


## originStrategies

A link to a paged [Collection](collections) of [origin strategies](origin-strategy). These are used when constructing [Customer Origin Strategies](origin-strategy#customeroriginstrategy) to assist the platform in fetching assets from your repositories.

See [Origin strategies](origin-strategy) for a discussion.

| domain | range | readonly | writeonly |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| vocab:EntryPoint | 🔗 hydra:Collection (of vocab:OriginStrategy) | True | False |

### HTTP operations

| Method | Label | Expects | Returns | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| GET | Retrieves global origin strategies | - | hydra:Collection | 200 OK |

## storagePolicies

A link to a paged [Collection](collections) of global storage policies. These represent pre-canned limits that your account might be assigned. You do not need to interact with these resources. See [Storage](storage) for more information.

| domain | range | readonly | writeonly |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| vocab:EntryPoint | 🔗 hydra:Collection (of vocab:StoragePolicy) | True | False |

### HTTP operations

| Method | Label | Expects | Returns | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| GET | Retrieves global storage policies | - | hydra:Collection | 200 OK |


## queue

The most common mechanism for adding new assets to the platform is to post batches of assets to your dedicated customer [queue](queue). The entry point also provides a link to this global queue, to report on the current workload of the platform.

| domain | range | readonly | writeonly |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| vocab:EntryPoint | 🔗 vocab:QueueSummary | True | False |

### HTTP operations

| Method | Label | Expects | Returns | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| GET | A read-only view of how busy the platform _as a whole_ is | - | vocab:QueueSummary | 200 OK |

See [Queues](queues) for more.
